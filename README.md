# Magic Chess Mythic Player Match History Dataset

Climbing to Mythic rank in Magic Chess is *tough*! The competition is fierce, and while many players turn to YouTube to follow meta strategies or ‚Äútemplates,‚Äù that often takes the fun out of the game. Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to dig into actual gameplay data from Mythic-level players and uncover what really works?

This dataset is built on that idea‚Äîlearning directly from top-tier match history to uncover the most effective patterns.


## ü§ù Pull Request Guide

If you'd like to contribute or add new match entries to this dataset, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Include a Match Screenshot:**  
   Make sure to attach a screenshot of the match result, similar to the ones in the `sources` directory of this repository.  

2. **File Naming:**  
   Name the screenshot using the **match ID**, which can be found marked in red (as shown in the example screenshot below).

3. **Why This Matters:**  
   This helps ensure data accuracy. If there's ever any doubt about an entry, we can refer back to the screenshot for verification.

4. **Season Updates:**  
   When a new season starts, please create a **new folder** named `season-#` (e.g., `season-3`) and store the dataset there.  
   Synergy and hero stats often change between patches, so keeping datasets separate by season helps maintain data integrity.
